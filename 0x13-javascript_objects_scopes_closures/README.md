# 0x12. Javascript - Warm up

`Javascript`

## Background Context
Javascript is used for many things. Here, you will use Javascript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (Same as we did  with Python)
- Web front-end

For the moment, and for learning all basic conceptd of this language, we will do some scripting. After , we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
