Python - if/else, loops, functions
Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming, specific to the Python programming language: if/elif/else loops, range, ord(), chr(), modulo, copy of string, bytecode

Description of each file
print whether the random number is positive or negative
print the last digit of the number stored in prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new linvariable
prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
prints numbers from 0 to 99
prints all possible different combinations of two digits
function that checks for lowercase character
function that prints the last digit of a number
function that print a string in uppercase followed by a new line
function that computes a to the power of b and return the value
function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space - FizzBuzz
function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list
prints the alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line
function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”)
Python function def magic-calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
